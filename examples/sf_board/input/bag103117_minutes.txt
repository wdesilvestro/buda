ADDENDUM

The following information is provided by speaker(s), pursuant to Administrative Code, Section 
67.16.  The content is neither generated by, nor subject to approval or verification of accuracy by, 
the Clerk of the Board or the Board of Supervisors.

Ray Hartz submitted the following additional information during General Public Comment, as 
follows:  “At the October 16, 2017 meeting of the Ethics Commission a hearing was held on a 
referral from the SOTF which found the Clerk of the BOS, Angela Calvillo, had once again violated 
the Sunshine Ordinance. It was the fifth time the Task Force had so determined! Ms. Calvillo didn’t 
bother to show because she knew what the outcome would be and relied upon BOS “Quisling,” 
Quentin Kopp. As it relates to the Sunshine Ordinance it is impossible to receive a fair hearing 
before the Unethical Commission! Those commissioners should read the Good Government 
Guide, particularly the section “Roles of Commissioners” In that section it refers to “due process,” 
and “making decisions upon the evidence and the governing law.” Exactly how is it “due process” 
when the outcome is predetermined? The Ethics Commission always finds against a complainant 
and for the respondent! Always, against the citizen and for the City!”
